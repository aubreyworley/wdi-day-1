I founded a book club called Bay Area Bookspiration. The mission of the club is to inspire, motivate, and encourage members to become avid readers through group interaction. The local chapter welcomes everyone, including those not local, to join the group, read along and come to meet-ups in person or online as we embark on shared book explorations. In only a few short months, 165 people joined the facebook group and are actively participating in the club. As the group continues to grow, I'd like to create a collaborative platform that can be used globally. The website would include book nominations, reviews, book club ideas, discussion questions. It would be an internet resource for book clubs around the world.
